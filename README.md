The goal for this app to to reduce the amount of paper used in hospitals. Doctors often struggle with remembering all of their patients.
So I thought what if there is an application for this. 
With my PatientApp the doctors are able to log in with their employeenumber. The doctors themselves are not able to register themselves 
because otherwise even people who aren't doctors could register themselves. 
You are able to log in with the following employeenumbers: 0622083790, 8898021567, 1999199694, 1234567890  and 0644807257. 
Please feel free to add, edit or remove a patient from one of these employees.
